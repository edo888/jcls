                    This component loggs complaints received by the one of following ways: (1) through a form on the website, (2) by sending an SMS message, (3) via e-mail.
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Web Logging:</b> The user would open the "Feedback" page at the site and enter key information (name, contacts, etc) along with details of the complaint.</li>
                        <li><b>SMS Logging:</b> Upon receipt of an SMS complaint an acknowledgement message would be returned to the complainant indicating that the message was received and will be processed. Upon resolution the complainant would receive a message which they can confirm that the resolution was satisfactory or otherwise. If the latter, additional steps will need to be done.</li>
                        <li><b>E-mail Logging:</b> An e-mail would be sent to an e-mail address. An auto-responder would send out an acknowledgement and the business flow would be the same as for SMS logging.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Upon receipt of a complaint, the message would be automatically forwarded via e-mail to at least three different users.  The reporting facility in the system would record the details of the message, sender information, when received, etc. Later, when resolved, the complainant will be notified by SMS if possible. The reporting system will record the elapsed time for dealing with the complaint as well as the outcome. The system allows anonymous complaints to be made if the displaced person wish to do so.
